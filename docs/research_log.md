# Research Log

Append-only research diary, newest entry at the bottom. Don't rewrite past
entries — if an earlier decision turns out wrong, add a new entry noting the
correction and why; the history of "what we believed when" is itself useful.

## 2026-08-31 — Repository initialized

**Context:** Starting the CGRN project from a research blueprint covering
motivation, architecture design space, hypotheses, benchmark plan, and
experiment sequence.

**Decision / finding:** Initialized the repository as reproducibility
scaffolding only — directory structure, docs, config/run/logging
conventions, generic (architecture-agnostic) training and evaluation
infrastructure, and stub files for baselines and for `architecture_v0`. No
architecture math was invented and no compartment/graph/plasticity logic was
implemented.

**Why:** The blueprint is explicit (see `docs/architecture_v0.md` and
`CLAUDE.md`) that `CellV0` has not been mathematically specified yet, and
that specifying it is a research decision for the user, not something a
coding agent should infer. Isolating this decision keeps the eventual
architecture experiments interpretable.

**Follow-up:** The next research task is **Architecture Specification
V0.1** — mathematically defining `CellV0` per `docs/architecture_v0.md` §7.
Only after that should `src/models/architecture_v0/cell.py` be implemented,
followed by Experiment 001 (baseline validation) and Experiment 002 (CellV0
alone).
